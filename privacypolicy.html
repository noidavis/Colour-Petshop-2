        <h2>1. PERSONAL DATA THAT WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h3>
            <p>
                We collect various types of information from you, as described below.

In some cases, this could include data that you give Us about someone else. For example, if you provide a friend’s email address for a tell-a-friend program. It may also include data about your pets and pet preferences. If you are a health care professional, We may collect data about your practice.
                Third-Party Social Network Data: Any data that you share publicly on a third-party social network or data that is part of your profile on a third-party social network (such as Facebook) and that you allow the third-party social network to share with Us.
